# WinSpotlightCopy
Copy images from the Spotlight (lockscreen images) folder to Downloads\WinSpotlight

Works with Python3.6+, though the most recent version is recomended since supported.<br />https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/

## Usage

Simply double click the script to use it.

You'll need Python Imaging Library (best to use pillow)
```
pip install pillow
```

Use only if you just want to periodically back up images that you are actually recieving, if you want to download MORE I suggest using [ORelio/Spotlight-Downloader](https://github.com/ORelio/Spotlight-Downloader)
